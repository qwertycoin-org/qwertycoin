### Installing

We offer binary images of the latest releases here: https://releases.qwertycoin.org

If you would like to compile yourself, read on.

### How To Compile

#### Linux

##### Prerequisites

- You will need the following packages: build-essential, [cmake (3.10 or higher)](https://github.com/qwertycoin-org/qwertycoin/wiki/E01.-Install-Cmake-3.10) and git;
- Most of these should already be installed on your system. For example on Ubuntu by running:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git
```

##### Building

- After installing dependencies run simple script:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/qwertycoin-org/qwertycoin
cd ./qwertycoin
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
- If all went well, it will complete successfully, and you will find all your binaries in the `./build/src` directory.

#### Windows 10

##### Prerequisites

- Install [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15&page=inlineinstall);
- When installing Visual Studio, it is **required** that you install **Desktop development with C++** and the **VC++ v140 toolchain** when selecting features. The option to install the v140 toolchain can be found by expanding the "Desktop development with C++" node on the right. You will need this for the project to build correctly;
- Make sure that bundled cmake version is 3.10 or higher.

##### Building

- From the start menu, open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for vs2017";
- And the run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/qwertycoin-org/qwertycoin
cd qwertycoin
md build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
- If all went well, it will complete successfully, and you will find all your binaries in the `.\build\src\Release` directory;
- Additionally, a `.sln` file will have been created in the `build` directory. If you wish to open the project in Visual Studio with this, you can.

#### Apple

##### Prerequisites

- Install Xcode and Developer Tools;
- Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/). See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23849962/cmake-installer-for-mac-fails-to-create-usr-bin-symlinks) if you are unable to call `cmake` from the terminal after installing;
- Install git.

##### Building

- After installing dependencies run simple script:
```
git clone https://github.com/qwertycoin-org/qwertycoin
cd ./qwertycoin
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
- If all went well, it will complete successfully, and you will find all your binaries in the `./build/src` directory.

#### Android (building on Linux)

##### Prerequisites

- You will need the following packages: build-essential, cmake (3.10 or higher), git, unzip and wget;
- Most of these should already be installed on your system. For example on Ubuntu by running:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git unzip wget
```
- Download and extract Android NDK:
```
mkdir -p "$HOME/.android"
wget -O "$HOME/.android/android-ndk-r18b-linux-x86_64.zip" "https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r18b-linux-x86_64.zip"
unzip -qq "$HOME/.android/android-ndk-r18b-linux-x86_64.zip" -d "$HOME/.android"
export ANDROID_NDK_r18b="$HOME/.android/android-ndk-r18b"
```

##### Building

- After installing dependencies run simple script:
```
git clone https://github.com/qwertycoin-org/qwertycoin
cd ./qwertycoin
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/polly/android-ndk-r18b-api-21-x86-clang-libcxx.cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DSTATIC=ON -DBUILD_64=OFF -DANDROID=true -DBUILD_TAG="android" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
- If all went well, it will complete successfully, and you will find all your binaries in the `./build/src` directory.

#### Advanced options (for all platforms)

* Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`;
* Debug build: run `make build-debug`;
* Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version;
* Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++` before running `make`.
